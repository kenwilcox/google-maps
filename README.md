google-maps
===========

Just playing around with the google maps API.

Just want to learn it, It now does a few things

- Puts a marker for your current location (if you allow it)
- Lets you choose from a combination of several different marker conbinations
- uses localStorage to remember which markers you placed
- loads your current location last (so the map is centered there)
